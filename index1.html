            <h4> ABOUT THE SONGWRITER </h4>
                        
            <br>
            A big dreamer. She has always dreamt of becoming a successful professional engineer. But, her artistic dreams have always got in her way. Growing up as an only child, she always believed that she could be anything she wanted. She always believed she could do everything, that she could be good in everything. She has always believed that she shall know everything for there would be nobody to support her but herself. As an escape, she has always expressed her emotions through poetries and music. Since she was a child, she has always been taught about different subfields of music. As she grew older, she had seen the beauty of the art. Songs have been her perfect expression as words and melodies give the most beautiful interpretations of her heart.
