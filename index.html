            A big dreamer. She has always dreamt of becoming a successful professional engineer. But, her artistic dreams have always got in her way. Growing up as an only child, she always believed that she could be anything she wanted. She always believed she could do everything, that she could be good in everything. She has always believed that she shall know everything for there would be nobody to support her but herself. As an escape, she has always expressed her emotions through poetries and music. Since she was a child, she has always been taught about different subfields of music. As she grew older, she had seen the beauty of the art. Songs have been her perfect expression as words and melodies give the most beautiful interpretations of her heart.

            <h3>  "Skies Above" </h3>
            <br>
            You made me realize
            <br> The world I should've known
            <br> I saw your face when skies were gray
            <br> You should've told me this before
            <br>
            <br> You gave me a pen that I'll hold
            <br> You said, "Write a song." and I wrote
            <br> A letter for you
            <br> When you're gold and old
            <br>
            <br> Was falling from the skies above
            <br> Creating marks from lights above
            <br> The shadows and the gallows
            <br> Were with our flight
            
            <br>
            <br> I'll be alone without you
            <br> I can't sing this song without you
            <br> I'l find your face, and ask for grace from God
            <br> That I'd keep you in my arms
            
            <br><br> You know that I'll find
            <br> Even though I am blind
            <br> I'll find your heart
            <br> 'Cause it beats with mine
            
            <br><br> You learned to open up your eyes
            <br> I helped you out to see the lights
            <br> When you're down
            
            <br><br> I'd help you up to see the heights
            <br> We'd float above and touch the skies
            <br> We'll fly
            
            <br><br> Was falling from the skies above
            <br> Creating marks from lights above
            <br> Though shadows and the gallows
            <br> Were with our flight
            
            <br><br>You made me realize
            <br> I should've soared with you before
            <br> To see the heights and touch the skies
            <br> With you, mi amore
