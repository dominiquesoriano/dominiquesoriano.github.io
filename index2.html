            <h4> BEHIND THE LYRICS </h4>
            <br>
            This song was written November 2017 by an amateur duo named "Expresso." It was written for a school songwriting competition, "Himig Busko" with the theme "Pagsibol." "Skies Above" is a song about a beautiful and selfless love that bloomed out of an inexplicable plain relationship. This is also about an against-all-odds kind of love where the two people involved are believing that they are truly destined for each other. This song is also considered as a promise song for it talks about an endless love considering the sky as its only limit. The rhythm goes on a 3/4 time signature manifesting a romantic waltz vibe. This song ended up 2nd runner up and was performed in various programs and events.
